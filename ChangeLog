	* R/ameliagui.r (*): Major overhaul to main window. Most actions
	moved to application menus or context menus. 

2009-09-22  Matthew Blackwell <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>
	* R/ameliagui.r (load.sessions, save.sessions): Sessions now
	properly handle the entry boxes on loading session. Sessions
	actually save bound matrix now.
	* R/diag.r (tscsPlot): Fixed a problem with rounding in the ceiling()
	function that caused the function to access the m+1st theta matrix,
	which obviously doesn't exist.
	* R/emb.r (amelia.impute): Fixed a problem when both bounds and
	priors were being used. 
	* R/missmap.R (missmap): Fixed a problem with the color inverting
	on a fully observed dataset. 

2009-09-10  Matthew Blackwell <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>
	* R/ameliagui.r: Sessions work properly and save Amelia
	runs. structure of the GUI file is sensible now, with separate
	functions so that things don't depend on scoping. 

2010-05-07  Matthew Blackwell <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>
	* R/plot.amelia (plot.amelia): 'ask' argument was unused in the
	function, should now not ask if ask=FALSE. 

2010-03-20  Matthew Blackwell <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>
	* R/emb.r (startval): use starting values of data with prior means
	in place of missing values. 
	* R/prep.r (amelia.prep): is.na(data) was an old
	reference. changed to is.na(x). 

2010-02-20  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>
	* R/prep.r (amsubset): intercs=TRUE with polytime=NULL creates
	fixed effects. 
	* R/prep.r (amsubset): fixed problem with 1 column of non-idvar
	variables. 
	* R/amcheck.r (amcheck): enforces one-variable only error when cs
	is set but not used in imputation.
	* R/amcheck.r (amcheck): fixed non.vary issue with only one
	non-idvar/cs variable. 

2009-11-17  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* R/prep.r (amsubset): theta.names now does not add false names
	with 0 polynomials and intercs=FALSE.

2009-11-16  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* R/emb.r (impfill): Ordinal variables only fill in on the missing
	values.
	* R/prep.r (unsubset): Ordinal variables are rounded to the
	nearest integer.  

2009-08-27  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* R/amcheck.r (amcheck): "noms" are now checked for 0 variance.

2009-08-09  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* R/amcheck.r (amcheck): Typo on categories. Fixed an error where
	checks for the number of categories indcluded 'NA' as a category. 

2009-07-11  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* R/ameliagui.r (AmeliaView): Typo when calling combobox: "widge"
	-> "widget"

2009-07-10  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* R/ameliagui.r (AmeliaView): Removed tests of 1.3 that were left in.

	* R/emb.r (emfred): Removed leftover test code/browser.

2009-07-07  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* R/amcheck.r (amcheck): Added a conditional statement to only
	  check for leftover factors if are actually leftover variables.	
	
2009-07-01  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* isnt/doc/amelia.tex: Removed, replaced with vignette/Sweave.
	* inst/doc/amelia.Rnw: Added, updated content and made it Sweave
	  compatible, used to be amelia-vign.Rnw.


2009-06-30  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* inst/docs/amelia-vign.Rnw: change discussion of empri to match
	  between Rd file and manual.
	* man/amelia.Rd: same.

	* R/diag.r (overimpute): changed "percent" to "fraction".
	* R/summary.amelia.R (summary.amelia): same.

2009-06-29  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>
	
	* R/emb.r (impfill): Changed class== calls to is.class calls.
	* R/amcheck.r (amcheck): Changed class== calls to is.class
	  calls. Added a check for ordered factors. Broke up the checks to
	  be more specific (fact, char, ord, etc).
	  
	* R/emb.r (startvals): Lowered the tolerance for non-positiv definite
	  matrices to switch to identity starting valuees.
	
	* R/emb.r (emfred, amelia.impute): solveLambda should include all
	  the missing values for that row, not just the ones with
	  priors. fixed this oversight.	 

	* R/emb.r (amelia.default): Error codes return invisibly now. 

	* R/emb.r (amelia.default): Added variable names to output mu and
	  covMatrices.
	  
	* R/amcheck.r (amcheck): Errors indicate problematic
	  variable. Changed identical(*, NULL) to is.null(*). Added a check
	  for zero length variables in the data frame (rare).

	* man/missmap.Rd: Updated docs on the missmap changes from
	  (2009-05-19).
	
2009-05-19  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>

	* R/missmap.R (missmap): Can now accept generic
	  matrices/dataframes and accepts time/cross-section arguments.

2009-05-14  Matthew Blackwell  <blackwel@fas.harvard.edu>
	
	* inst/doc/copyRd: Added to copy Rd files into Sweave manual
	  (amelia-vign.Rnw).

	* R/missmap.R (missmap): Switched default color scheme. 

	* data/freetrade.RData: Added Milner/Kubota free trade data.
	* man/freetrade.Rd: Created man page for freetrade data.
	* man/africa.Rd: same.

	* R/write.amelia.R (write.amelia): Set Call$format to NULL to
