\section*{Acknowledgments}  

The Zelig project would not have been possible without considerable
help from many sources.  Our special thanks go to the \hlink{R core
  team}{http://www.r-project.org/contributors.html} for providing an
excellent modular, open-source platform for the entire statistics and
methodological community.

The authors of the following R packages have provided some of the
models available through Zelig: {\tt MASS} by William N. Venables and
Brian D. Ripley; {\tt MCMCpack} by Andrew D. Martin and Kevin M.
Quinn; {\tt survival} by Terry Therneau and Brian D. Ripley; and {\tt
  VGAM} by Thomas Yee.  

The authors of the following R packages have provided some of the
auxiliary statistical procedures and methods available through Zelig:
{\tt boot} by Angelo Canty and Brian Ripley; {\tt coda} by Martyn
Plummer, Nicky Best, Kate Cowles, and Karen Vines; {\tt sandwich} by
Achim Zeileis; and {\tt zoo} by Achim Zeileis and Gabor Grothendieck.

Our appreciation also goes to Ferdinand Almahdi, Ben Goodrich, Yang
Lin, and Ying Lu, who have contributed either code or documentation; Dan Hopkins, 
Ian Yohai, and others who have given valuable feedback from the courses in which 
they have used Zelig as a teaching tool.
