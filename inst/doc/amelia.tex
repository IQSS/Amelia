\section{What's New:  Zelig Release Notes}\label{release.notes}

Releases listed as ``stable releases'' have been tested against prior
versions of Zelig for consistency and accuracy.  Testing distributions
may contain bugs, but are usually replaced by stable releases within a
few days.

\section{What's Next?}

We have several plans for expanding and improving Zelig.  Major
changes slated for Version 3.0 (and beyond) include:  

\begin{itemize}
\item Hierarchical and multi-level models
\item Ecological inference models
\item GEE models
\item Neural network models
\item Average treatment effects for everyone (treated and control
units)
\item Cross-validation
\item Time-series cross-sectional models (via {\tt nlme})
\item ARIMA models
\item Generalized boosted regression model (via {\tt gbm})
\item Saving random seeds to ensure exact replication
\end{itemize}
