\chapter{Frequently Asked Questions}

\section{For All Zelig Users}

\subsection*{How do I cite Zelig?}
We would appreciate if you would cite Zelig as:  
\begin{verse}
  Imai, Kosuke, Gary King and Olivia Lau.  2005.  ``Zelig:
  Everyone's Statistical Software,''   \url{http://GKing.Harvard.Edu/zelig}.
\end{verse}
Please also cite the contributors for the models or methods you are
using.  These citations can be found in the contributors section of
each model or command page.

\subsection*{Why can't I install Zelig?}

You must be connected to the internet to install packages from web
depositories.  In addition, there are a few platform-specific reasons
why you may have installation problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{On Windows}: If you are using the very latest version of
  R, you may not be able to install Zelig until we update Zelig to
  work on the latest release of R. If you wish to install Zelig in the
  interim, check the Zelig release notes (\Sref{release.notes}) and
  download the appropriate version of R to work with the last release
  of Zelig.  You may have to manually download and install Zelig.  

\item \textbf{On Mac or Linux systems}:  If you get the following
  warning message at the end of your installation:  
\begin{verbatim}
Installation of package VGAM had non-zero exit status in ...
\end{verbatim}
this means that you were not able to install VGAM properly.  Make sure
that you have the g77 Fortran compiler (available for free download at
\hlink{http://hpc.sourceforge.net}{http://hpc.sourceforge.net}) and
try again.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Why can't I install R?}

If you have problems installing R (rather than Zelig), you should
check the \hlink{R FAQs}{http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html} for your
platform.  If you still have problems, you can search the
\hlink{archives}{https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help}
for the R help mailing list, or email the list directly at
\hlink{r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch}{mailto:r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch}.  

\subsection*{Why can't I load data?}

When you start R, you need to specify your working directory.  In
linux R, this is done pretty much automatically when you start R,
whether within ESS or in a terminal window.  In Windows R, you may
wish to specify a working directory so that you may load data without
typing in long directory paths to your data files, and it is important
to remember that \emph{Windows} R uses the \emph{Linux} directory
delimiter. That is, if you right click and select the ``Properties''
link on a Windows file, the slashes are backslashes ($\backslash$), but Windows R 
uses forward slashes ({\tt /}) in directory paths.  Thus, the Windows
link may be {\tt C:$\backslash$Program Files$\backslash$R$\backslash$\rwvers$\backslash$}, but you would type
 {\tt C:/Program Files/R/\rwvers/} in Windows R.

When you start R in Windows, the working directory is by default the
directory in which the R executible is located.
\begin{verbatim}
# Print your current working directory.  
> getwd()                                    

# To read data not located in your working directory. 
> data <- read.table("C:/Program Files/R/newwork/mydata.tab")

# To change your working directory.  
> setwd("C:/Program Files/R/newwork")

# Reading data in your working directory.
> data <- read.data("mydata.tab")
\end{verbatim}
Once you have set the working directory, you no longer need to type
the entire directory path.  

\subsection*{Where can I find old versions of Zelig?} 

For some replications, you may require older versions of Zelig. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Windows} users may find old binaries at
\url{http://gking.harvard.edu/bin/windows/contrib/}
and selecting the appropriate version of R.

\item {\bf Linux} and {\bf MacOSX} users may find source files at
\url{http://gking.harvard.edu/src/contrib/} 
\end{itemize}  
If you want an older version of Zelig because you are using an older
version of R, we strongly suggest that you update R and install the
latest version of Zelig.  

\subsection*{Who can I ask for help?  How do I report bugs?}

If you find a bug, or cannot figure something out, please follow these
steps: (1) Reread the relevant section of \hlink{the
  documentation}{http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig/docs/}.  (2)
\hlink{Update
  Zelig}{http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig/docs/Installation.html} if you
don't have the current version.  (3) Rerun the same code and see if
the bug has been fixed.  (4) Check our list
of \hlink{frequently asked
  questions}{http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig/docs/Frequently_Asked_Quest.html}.
(5) \hlink{Search or browse
  messages}{http://lists.hmdc.harvard.edu/lists/zelig/} to find a
discussion of your issue on the zelig listserv.

If none of these work, then if you haven't already, please (6)
\hlink{subscribe to the Zelig
  listserv}{http://lists.hmdc.harvard.edu/index.cgi?info=zelig} and
(7) send your question to the listserv at
\texttt{zelig@latte.harvard.edu}.  Please explain exactly what you did
and include the full error message, including the {\tt traceback()}.
You should get an answer from the developers or another user in short
order.

\subsection*{How do I increase the memory for R?}

Windows users may get the error that R has run out of memory.  

If you have R already installed and subsequently install more RAM, you
may have to reinstall R in order to take advantage of the additional
capacity.

You may also set the amount of available memory manually.  Close R,
then right-click on your R program icon (the icon on your desktop or
in your programs directory). Select ``Properties'', and then select
the ``Shortcut'' tab.  Look for the ``Target'' field and after the
closing quotes around the location of the R executible, add
\begin{verbatim}
--max-mem-size=500M
\end{verbatim}
as shown in the figure below.  You may increase this value up to 2GB
or the maximum amount of physical RAM you have installed.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figs/increase}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

If you get the error that R cannot allocate a vector of length x,
close out of R and add the following line to the ``Target'' field:  
\begin{verbatim}
--max-vsize=500M
\end{verbatim}
or as appropriate.  

You can always check to see how much memory R has available by typing
at the R prompt
\begin{verbatim}
> round(memory.limit()/2^20, 2)
\end{verbatim}
which gives you the amount of available memory in MB.  

%\subsection*{I still run out of memory!  Now what?}

%Most users who run out of memory do so because they choose in-sample
%prediction ({\tt setx(\dots, fn = NULL, \dots)}).  To get around this, you 
%can write a loop for {\tt sim()}:  

%\begin{verbatim}
%z.out <- zelig(...)
%x.out <- setx(z.out, fn = NULL, ...)
%s.out <- sim(z.out, x = x.out[1,])
%for (i in 2:nrow(x.out)) {
%  tmp <- summary(sim(z.out, x = xout[i,]))
%  results <- prior.average(results, tmp, i)
%}
%results
%\end{verbatim}
%where {\tt prior.average()} is a special function we have written to 
%calculate running summary statistics.  

\subsection*{Why doesn't the pdf print properly?} 

Zelig uses several special \LaTeX\ environments.  If the pdf looks right
on the screen, there are two possible reasons why it's not printing
properly:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Adobe Acrobat isn't cleaning up the document.  Updating to
  Acrobat Reader 6.0.1 or higher should solve this problem.  
\item Your printer doesn't support PostScript Type 3 fonts.  Updating
  your print driver should take care of this problem.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{R is neat.  How can I find out more?}

R is a collective project with contributors from all over the world.
Their website
(\hlink{{\tt http://www.r-project.org}}{http://www.r-project.org}) has more
information on the R project, R packages, conferences, and other
learning material.

In addition, there are several canonical references which you may
wish to peruse:
\begin{verse}
Venables, W.N. and B.D. Ripley.  2002. \emph{Modern Applied Statistics with S.} 4th Ed.  Springer-Verlag.  \\
Venables, W.N. and B.D. Ripley.  2000. \emph{S Programming.} Springer-Verlag.  \\
\end{verse}

\section{For Zelig Contributors}

\subsection*{Where can I find the source code for Zelig?}

Zelig is distributed under the \hlink{GNU General Public License,
Version 2}{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt}.  After installation,
the source code is located in your R library directory.  For Linux
users who have followed our installation example, this is {\tt
\~{}/.R/library/Zelig/}.  For Windows users under R \fullrvers, this is by
default {\tt C:$\backslash$Program Files$\backslash$R$\backslash$\rwvers$\backslash$library$\backslash$Zelig$\backslash$}.
For Macintosh users, this is {\tt \~{}/Library/R/library/Zelig/}.

In addition, you may download the latest Zelig
source code as a tarball'ed directory from
\hlink{{\tt http://gking.harvard.edu/src/contrib/}}{http://gking.harvard.edu/src/contrib/}.  
(This makes it easier to distinguish functions which are run together during installation.)

\subsection*{How can I make my R programs run faster?}

Unlike most commercial statistics programs which rely on precompiled
and pre-packaged routines, R allows users to program functions and run
them in the same environment.  If you notice a perceptible lag when
running your R code, you may improve the performance of your programs
by taking the following steps:

\begin{itemize}

\item Reduce the number of loops.  If it is absolutely necessary to run 
loops in loops, the inside loop should have the most number of cycles
because it runs faster than the outside loop.  Frequently, you can
eliminate loops by using vectors rather than scalars. Most R functions
deal with vectors in an efficient and mathematically intuitive manner.

\item Do away with loops altogether.  You can vectorize functions 
using the {\tt apply}, {\tt mapply()}, {\tt sapply()}, {\tt lapply()},
and {\tt replicate()} functions.  If you specify the function passed
to the above {\tt *apply()} functions properly, the R consensus is that
they should run significantly faster than loops in general.

\item You can compile your code using C or Fortran.  R is not compiled, 
but can use bits of precompiled code in C or Fortran, and
calls that code seamlessly from within R wrapper functions (which pass
input from the R function to the C code and back to R).  Thus, almost
every regression package includes C or Fortran algorithms, which are
locally compiled in the case of Linux systems or precompiled in the
case of Windows distributions.  The recommended Linux compilers are
gcc for C and g77 for Fortran, so you should make sure that your code
is compatible with those standards to achieve the widest possible
distribution.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Which compilers can I use with R and Zelig?}

In general, the C or Fortran algorithms in your package should compile
for any platform.  While Windows R packages are distributed as
compiled binaries, Linux R compiles packages locally during
installation.  Thus, to ensure the widest possible audience for your
package, you should make sure that your code will compile on gcc (for
C and C++), or on g77 (for Fortran).
