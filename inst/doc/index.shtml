<p>Amelia II "multiply imputes" missing data in a single cross-section
  (such as a survey) or from a time-series-cross-sectional data set
  (such as collected by years for each of several countries).  Amelia
  II implements a bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives essentially
  the same answers as IP or EMis, is faster than existing approaches
  and, unlike Amelia I and other statistically rigorous imputation
  software, virtually never crashes (but please let us know if you
  find to the contrary!).  The program also generalizes existing
  approaches by allowing for trends in time
  across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as 
  priors that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about
  the values of particular missing cells in their data.  Amelia II
  also includes a useful diagnostic of the fit of multiple imputation
  models.  The program works from the R command line or via a
  graphical user interface that does not require users to know R.

 <p> Multiple imputation involves imputing <em>m</em> values for each missing
  cell in your data matrix and creating <em>m</em> "completed" data sets.
  (Across these completed data sets, the observed values are the same,
  but the missing values are filled in with different imputations that
  reflect our uncertainty about the missing data.)  After imputation,
  Amelia will then save the <em>m</em> data
  sets.  You then apply whatever statistical method you would have used
  if there had been no missing values to each of the <em>m</em> data sets,
  and use a simple procedure to
  combine the results.  Under normal circumstances, you
  only need to impute once and can then analyze the <em>m</em> imputed
  data  sets as many times and for as many purposes as you wish.  The
  advantage of Amelia is that it combines the comparative speed and
  ease-of-use of our algorithm with the power of multiple
  imputation, to let you focus on your substantive research questions
  rather than spending time developing complex application-specific
  models for nonresponse in each new data set.  Unless the rate of
  missingness is exceptionally high, <em>m=5</em> (the program
  default) will usually be adequate.  Other methods of dealing with
  missing data, such as listwise deletion, mean substitution, or
  single imputation, are in common circumstances biased, inefficient,
  or both.  <p>
