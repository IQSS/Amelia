Amelia is named after this famous missing person.</small></p>


<p>Amelia II "multiply imputes" missing data in a single cross-section
  (such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for
  each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data
  set (such as collected by years for each of several countries).
  Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives
  essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches,
  is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can
  handle many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
  rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please
  let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program also
  generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series
  across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors
  that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values
  of missing cells in their data.  Amelia II also includes useful
  diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.  The program
  works from the R command line or via a graphical user interface that
  does not require users to know R.

 <p> Multiple imputation involves imputing <em>m</em> values for each
 missing cell in your data matrix and creating <em>m</em> "completed"
 data sets.
  (Across these completed data sets, the observed values are the same,
  but the missing values are filled in with different imputations that
  reflect our uncertainty about the missing data.)  After imputation,
  Amelia will then save the <em>m</em> data
  sets.  You then apply whatever statistical method you would have used
  if there had been no missing values to each of the <em>m</em> data sets,
  and use a simple procedure to combine the results.  Under normal
  circumstances, you
  only need to impute once and can then analyze the <em>m</em> imputed
  data sets as many times and for as many purposes as you wish.  The
  advantage of Amelia is that it combines the comparative speed and
  ease-of-use of our algorithm with the power of multiple
  imputation, to let you focus on your substantive research questions
  rather than spending time developing complex application-specific
  models for nonresponse in each new data set.  Unless the rate of
  missingness is exceptionally high, <em>m=5</em> (the program
  default) will usually be adequate.  Other methods of dealing with
  missing data, such as listwise deletion, mean substitution, or
  single imputation, are in common circumstances biased, inefficient,
  or both.  When multiple imputation works properly, it fills in data
  in such a way as to not change any relationships in the data but
  which enables the inclusion of all the observed data in the
  partially missing rows.

<p>Amelia II is a new program, and follows in the spirit with the same
purpose as the first version of Amelia (still available <a

Joseph, Gary King, Kenneth Scheve, and Naunihal Singh.
