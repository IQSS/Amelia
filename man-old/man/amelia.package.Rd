You can use the package in one of two ways:  either by invoking the 
\code{ameliagui()} command and running the program from a graphical 
interface or by loading in your data and then running the \code{amelia}
function on the data.

If you use the GUI in Windows, makes sure that you run R under a Single
Window Interface (SDI) as it will try to grab focus from the GUI if
you don't.
