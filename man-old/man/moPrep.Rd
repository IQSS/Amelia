\title{Prepare Multiple Overimputation Settings}
\description{
  A function to generate priors for multiple overimputation of
  a variable measured with error.
}
\usage{
moPrep(x, formula, subset, error.proportion,
       gold.standard = !missing(subset), error.sd)


}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{either a matrix, data.frame, or a object of class "molist"
    from a previous \code{moPrep} call. The first two derive the priors
    from the data given, and the third will derive the priors from the
    first \code{moPrep} call and add them to the already defined
    priors.}
  \item{formula}{a formula describing the nature of the measurement
    error for the variable. See "Details."}
  \item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations
    which possess measurement error.}
  \item{error.proportion}{an optional vector specifying the fraction of
    the observed variance that is due to measurement error.}
  \item{gold.standard}{a logical value indicating if values with no
    measurement error should be used to estimate the measurement error
    variance.}
  \item{error.sd}{an optional vector specifying the standard error of
    the measurement error.}
}
\value{
  An instance of the S3 class "molist" with the following objects:
  \item{priors}{a four-column matrix of the multiple overimputation priors
    associated with the data. Each row of the matrix is \code{c(row,
      column, prior.mean, prior.sd)}. }
  \item{overimp}{a two-column matrix of cells to be overimputed. Each
    row of the matrix is of the form \code{c(row, column)}, which
    indicate the row and column of the cell to be overimputed.}
  \item{data}{the object name of the matrix or data.frame to which
    priors refer.}
  
  Note that \code{priors} and \code{overimp} might contain results from
  multiple calls to \code{moPrep}, not just the most recent. 
}
\details{
  This function generates priors for multiple overimputation of data
  measured with error. With the \code{formula} arugment, you can specify
  which variable has the error, what the mean of the latent data is, and
  if there are any other proxy measures of the mismeasured variable. The
  general syntax for the formula is: \code{errvar ~ mean | proxy},
  where \code{errvar} is the mismeasured variable, \code{mean} is a
  formula for the mean of the latent variable (usually just
  \code{errvar} itself), and \code{proxy} is a another mismeasurement of
  the same latent variable. The proxies are used to estimate the
  variance of the measurement error. 

  \code{subset} and \code{gold.standard} refer to the the rows of the
  data which are and are not measured with error. Gold-standard rows are
  used to estimate the variance of the
  measurement. error. \code{error.proportion} is used to estimate the
  variance of the measurement error by estimating the variance of the
  mismeasurement and taking the proportion assumed to be due to
  error. \code{error.sd} sets the standard error of the measurement
  error directly.
